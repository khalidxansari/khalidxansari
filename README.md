👋 Hi, I’m Khalid Ansari (@khalidxansari)

📚 I’m passionate about Digital Asset and Media Management, with a focus on using AI-driven workflows to enrich metadata and make unexplored archives more accessible.

🧠 I’m currently exploring Python for computer vision, R for data analysis, and interactive visualizations with Tableau and D3.js.

🧭 My research bridges Digital Humanities, AI, and Cultural Memory, with a deep interest in oral histories and open access GLAM collections.

🗣️ Pronouns: He/Him

🌍 Fun fact: I’m fluent in five languages, and three of them have no written script—a powerful reminder of the value of oral traditions.
